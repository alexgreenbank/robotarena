# robotarena

Robot Arena programming game based on a version seen in the 1980s on the RM 380Z and 480Z. 

Robots are written in a robot assembly language (eventually compilers from higher level
languages will be provided) and run against one another. They have radars to find other
robots (up to 5 per battle), can fire missiles, protect themselves with shields and move
around a defined arena.

The goal is to write the smartest robot to win the highest proportion of matches.
